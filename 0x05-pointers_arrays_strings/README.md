### Description
This project is about programming in C: manipulate pointers, arrays and strings.

### Files
#### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-reset_to_98.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c) | Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98. |
| [1-swap.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c) | Function that swaps the values of two integers. |
| [2-strlen.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c) | Function that returns the length of a string. |
| [3-puts.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c) | Function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. |
| [4-print_rev.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c) | Function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| [5-rev_string.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c) | Function that reverses a string. |
| [6-puts2.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c) | Function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. |
| [7-puts_half.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c) | Function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2 |
| [8-print_array.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c) | Function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. |
| [9-strcpy.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c) | Function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. |
