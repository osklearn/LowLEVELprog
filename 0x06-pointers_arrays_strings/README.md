## 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This project is about programming in C: Pointers, arrays and strings

## Mandatory Tasks

| Files | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Files | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0-strcat.c | Function that concatenates two strings. This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte |
| 1. strncat | Function that concatenates two strings. The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that

    it will use at most n bytes from src; and
    src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes |

| 2. strncpy | Function that copies a string. |
| 3-strcmp.c | Function that compares two strings.The function should work exactly like strcmp |
| 4-rev_array.c | Function that reverses the content of an array of integers. |
| 5-string_toupper.c | Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase. |
| 6-cap_string.c | Function that capitalizes all words of a string. Remember the separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and } |
| 7-leet.c | Function that encodes a string into 1337. Conditions:
- Only use one if in your code
- Only use two loops in your code
- Not allowed to use switch
- Not allowed to use any ternary operation |
| 8-rot13.c | Function that encodes a string using rot13. Requeriments:

    Only use if statement once in your code
    Only use two loops in your code
    Not allowed to use switch
    not allowed to use any ternary operation |
