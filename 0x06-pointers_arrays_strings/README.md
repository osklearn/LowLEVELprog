### Mandatory Tasks

| Files | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [0-strcat.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/0-strcat.c) | Function that concatenates two strings. This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte |
| [1-strncat.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/1-strncat.c) | Function that concatenates two strings. The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes |
| [2. strncpy](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strncpy.c) | Function that copies a string. |
| [3-strcmp.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strcmp.c) | Function that compares two strings.The function should work exactly like strcmp |
| [4-rev_array.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/4-rev_array.c) | Function that reverses the content of an array of integers. |
| [5-string_toupper.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/5-string_toupper.c) | Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase. |
| [6-cap_string.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/6-cap_string.c) | Function that capitalizes all words of a string. Remember the separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and } |
| [7-leet.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/7-leet.c) | Function that encodes a string into 1337. Conditions: Only use one if in your code; Only use two loops in your code; Not allowed to use switch; Not allowed to use any ternary operation |
| [8-rot13.c](https://github.com/dalexach/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/8-rot13.c) | Function that encodes a string using rot13. Requeriments: Only use if statement once in your code; Only use two loops in your code; Not allowed to use switch; Not allowed to use any ternary operation |
